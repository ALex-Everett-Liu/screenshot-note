## 🔧 Technical Details

### Architecture Changes
- **From**: Browser-based web app with localStorage
- **To**: Electron desktop app with Express server + file system

### Data Storage
- **From**: localStorage in browser
- **To**: JSON files in `data/` directory + images in `assets/screenshots/`

### API Endpoints
- `GET /api/screenshots` - Load all screenshots
- `POST /api/screenshots` - Save screenshots data
- `POST /api/upload` - Upload new images
- `GET /api/data/:filename` - Load specific JSON file
- `POST /api/data/:filename` - Save JSON data
- `GET /api/data` - List available JSON files

### IPC Communication
- File dialog operations (select, save, import)
- Image file copying to assets directory
- JSON file reading/writing

## 🎯 Key Improvements
