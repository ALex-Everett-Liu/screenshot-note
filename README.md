## Development

### Architecture

The app uses a three-tier architecture:

1. **Main Process** (`main.js`): Handles window management, file dialogs, and system integration
2. **Express Server** (`server.js`): Provides REST API for data management and file operations
3. **Renderer Process** (`renderer.js`): Manages the user interface and client-side functionality

### API Endpoints

- `GET /api/screenshots` - Load all screenshots data
- `POST /api/screenshots` - Save screenshots data
- `POST /api/upload` - Upload image files
- `GET /api/data/:filename` - Load specific JSON file
- `POST /api/data/:filename` - Save JSON data to file
- `GET /api/data` - List available JSON files
- `GET /api/info` - Get application information

### Build for Distribution

To create distributable packages:

```bash
npm install electron-builder --save-dev
npm run build
```

This will create platform-specific packages in the `dist/` directory.

## Keyboard Shortcuts

### Full Screen Viewer
- `Escape` - Close full screen viewer
- `+` or `=` - Zoom in
- `-` or `_` - Zoom out  
- `0` - Reset zoom to 100%
- Mouse wheel - Zoom in/out
- Click and drag - Pan when zoomed in

### General
- Drag and drop images anywhere in the app to add them

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Port Already in Use**
If you get a port conflict error, the Express server (port 3019) might already be running. Close any other instances of the app or change the port in `server.js`.

**Images Not Loading**
Check that image files exist in the `assets/screenshots/` directory and that paths in the JSON data are correct.

**Import Issues**  
Ensure JSON files follow the correct format. Use the diagnostic function (Settings ‚Üí Diagnose Data) to check for issues.

**Performance with Many Images**
For better performance with large collections:
- Keep individual image files under 5MB
- Consider organizing data into multiple JSON files
- Use the search function to filter large collections

### Debug Mode

Run in development mode to access Chrome DevTools:
```bash
npm run dev
```

Press F12 or Ctrl+Shift+I to open developer tools.
